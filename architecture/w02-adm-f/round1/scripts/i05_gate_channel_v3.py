"""I05 broker-gate channel v3 (W02-ADM-F): frame envelope, gate state machine and outcome mapping.

DATA_CHECK_ONLY reference model for the private interface between the capacity broker and
the effect gate (HOST-INTERFACE-DRAFT-002 sections 3.2, 4.3, 6 and 7). It is the W02-ADM-F
successor of `i05_gate_channel_v2` (adopted and frozen), which answered the v1 round-3 findings
P1-P8. v3 changes only what the v2 review carried (V1, V3-V6): a bounded upstream exchange
(UPSTREAM_TIMEOUT aborts it), a finer test injection of storage failures, explicit refusal of an
incomplete priorBindings record, and wording.

- `decode_frame` and `check_frame` check one frame: canonical duplicate-free bytes, exact
  builtins, the closed schema and the envelope bounds.
- `render_request` derives the one I04 request an armed action permits (method, path,
  query, headers and body).
- `Gate` replays a transcript of broker frames, I04 connection events, upstream events and
  failures, and returns every gate decision: response payloads, fatal channel closures,
  forwarding decisions with the refusal reason, the I07 drain answer, and the resulting
  generation state. Every state change the gate relies on after a restart is a durable journal
  record; a failed record also writes a failure marker on a separate failure domain, and a
  restart rebuilds the gate's actions from the journal and the marker alone.
- `check_agreement` applies the ACTION_OUTCOME to RESOURCE_RESULT mapping table.

None of it opens a socket, forwards a request or grants authority. A gate response is an
observation of gate-owned state, never a capability.
