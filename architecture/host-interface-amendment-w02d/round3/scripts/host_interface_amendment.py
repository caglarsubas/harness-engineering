"""W01-AMEND: W02d's carried items as a reviewed amendment of the resolved W01 host-interface specification.

The resolved specification (architecture/host-interface-inputs/resolved/HOST_INTERFACE_SPEC.md) stays byte-identical:
later layers freeze it, and this module pins its digest. The amendment record
(architecture/host-interface-amendment-w02d/amendment.json) lists exact, counted substring replacements, each citing its
owner decisions; every item W02d carried to W01 (architecture/seccomp-allowlists/status.json, carriedToW01) has a
disposition naming the items and obligations that answer it. effective_spec() applies the replacements to the pinned
base bytes and must give exactly the pinned effective bytes, which are published beside the record.

check(read) validates the record, the carried items, the base and the published effective specification through an
injected byte reader, so a history-chain layer can pass its reviewed_bytes.
