"""W02d successor v3 (owner decision W02d-V3): the v2 model, which also requires that mremap is granted only with flags MREMAP_MAYMOVE outside the roles that run or cover the CPython base, and that prctl is granted only for PR_SET_NAME (and the broker's PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS).

W02d successor v2 (W01-AMEND, owner decisions QW1 and QW3 = M-a): the W02d model with only the memfd_create flags rule changed to MFD_CLOEXEC | MFD_NOEXEC_SEAL; no role may grant pidfd_send_signal (QW1) or setgroups (QW2).

Per-role, per-architecture seccomp allowlists (W02d): closed data, reference decision, compiler and digest.

DATA_CHECK_ONLY reference model for the seccomp half of HOST-INTERFACE-DRAFT-002 section 5.3 (mode 2, default
KILL_PROCESS) and the bpf command limit of section 5.1, for the seven roles on x86_64 and aarch64 at the pinned
kernel v6.12.

- `effective_rules(policy, table, role, arch)` merges a role's runtime base and duty rows into one rule per syscall.
- `decide(...)` is the reference semantics: KILL_PROCESS for a wrong architecture, an x32 call, an unlisted syscall or
  a listed syscall whose argument conditions all fail; ALLOW otherwise.
- `compile_filter(...)` emits the deterministic classic-BPF program a role installs; `run_filter(...)` interprets a
  program on one `struct seccomp_data`; the vectors show the two agree.
- `filter_digest(...)` is the SHA-256 of the program as the kernel receives it (the `sock_filter` array,
  little-endian): the record's `seccompFilterDigest` (owner decision W02d-Q3).
- `check_policy(...)` refuses a policy that grants what W01 sections 5.1 and 5.3 deny.

It is not a filter installed on a host, and it proves nothing about the role code that will run under it.
